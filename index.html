			<h4>The Baker’s Tale</h4>
			</div>

			<div class="stanza">
			<p>They roused him with muffins — they roused him with ice&nbsp;—</p>

			<p> They roused him with mustard and cress&nbsp;—</p>

			<p>They roused him with jam and judicious advice&nbsp;—</p>

			<p> They set him conundrums to guess.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="stanza">
			<p>When at length he sat up and was able to speak,</p>

			<p> His sad story he offered to tell;</p>

			<p>And the Bellman cried “Silence! Not even a shriek!”</p>

			<p> And excitedly tingled his bell.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="stanza">
			<p>There was silence supreme! Not a shriek, not a scream,</p>

			<p> Scarcely even a howl or a groan,</p>

			<p>As the man they called “Ho!” told his story of woe</p>

			<p> In an antediluvian tone.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="stanza">
			<p>“My father and mother were honest, though poor —”</p>

			<p> “Skip all that!” cried the Bellman in haste.</p>

			<p>“If it once becomes dark, there’s no chance of a Snark&nbsp;—</p>

			<p> We have hardly a minute to waste!”</p>
			</div>

			<div class="stanza">
			<p>“I skip forty years,” said the Baker, in tears,</p>

			<p> “And proceed without further remark</p>

			<p>To the day when you took me aboard of your ship</p>

			<p> To help you in hunting the Snark.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="stanza">
			<p>“A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named)</p>

			<p> Remarked, when I bade him farewell —”</p>

			<p>“Oh, skip your dear uncle!” the Bellman exclaimed,</p>

			<p> As he angrily tingled his bell.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="stanza">
			<p>“He remarked to me then,” said that mildest of men,</p>

			<p> “ ‘If your Snark be a Snark, that is right:</p>

			<p>Fetch it home by all means — you may serve it with greens,</p>

			<p> And it’s handy for striking a light.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="stanza">
			<p>“ ‘You may seek it with thimbles — and seek it with care;</p>

			<p> You may hunt it with forks and hope;</p>

			<p>You may threaten its life with a railway-share;</p>

			<p> You may charm it with smiles and soap —’ ”</p>

			<div class="stanza">
			<p>(“That’s exactly the method,” the Bellman bold</p>

			<p> In a hasty parenthesis cried,</p>

			<p>“That’s exactly the way I have always been told</p>

			<p> That the capture of Snarks should be tried!”)</p>
			</div>

			<div class="stanza">
			<p>“ ‘But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day,</p>

			<p> If your Snark be a Boojum! For then</p>

			<p>You will softly and suddenly vanish away,</p>

			<p> And never be met with again!’</p>

			</p>

			<div class="stanza">
			<p>“It is this, it is this that oppresses my soul,</p>

			<p> When I think of my uncle’s last words:</p>

			<p>And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl</p>

			<p> Brimming over with quivering curds!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="stanza">
			<p>“It is this, it is this —” “We have had that before!”</p>

			<p> The Bellman indignantly said.</p>

			<p>And the Baker replied “Let me say it once more.</p>

			<p> It is this, it is this that I dread!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="stanza">
			<p>“I engage with the Snark — every night after dark&nbsp;—</p>

			<p> In a dreamy delirious fight:</p>

			<p>I serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes,</p>

			<p> And I use it for striking a light:</p>
			</div>

			<div class="stanza">
			<p>“But if ever I meet with a Boojum, that day,</p>

			<p> In a moment (of this I am sure),</p>

			<p>I shall softly and suddenly vanish away&nbsp;—</p>

			<p> And the notion I cannot endure!”</p>
